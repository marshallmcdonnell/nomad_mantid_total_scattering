Total Scattering Data Reduction using Mantid Framework for NOMAD
-----------------------------------------------------------

This project is trying to implement total scattering datareduction for NOMAD (https://neutrons.ornl.gov/nomad) using the algorithms currently available in the Mantid framework (https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid)

Diagnostic tools and reduction scripts are included.
